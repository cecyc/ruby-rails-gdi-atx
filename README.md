## Day 2: Intro to Rails

Day 2 is a more hands on day with the teacher showing how Rails works and having the students follow along with each step. This day relies more heaviliy on class notes than slides as the teacher and students build a simple Twitter clone together.

Topics covered:

* installing Rails
* MVC basics
* setting up your db (postgres)
* generating and running migrations
* routing
* models
* controllers
* views

Tools used: Cloud9 cloud-based Rails development environment. This was chosen to ensure everyone was on the same environment (Mac _and_ PC). Alternatively, students can develop locally if they want to install Ruby and Rails on their machine.
